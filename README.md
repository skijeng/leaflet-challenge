# leaflet-challenge

For this project, I primarily used help from in class examples and other students. I am still working on how to add a legend to show depth of the earthquake. When going live, click on the "part 1" folder to open the map if the map does not load immediately. I set green, yellow, and red for least to deepest depth. The bigger the bubble, the greater magnitude of the earthquake. I used x1000 multiplier to give the eye an easier time seeing the magnitude differences.
